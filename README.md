This is a practice project I'm working on, for learning PHP, Symfony, Twig, and Doctrine.

### Setting up the development environment

Setting up the development environment is an essential step in any project. To get started, I decided to use a VMware Virtual Machine running Linux Ubuntu 22.04 and installed the latest versions of the necessary tools, including Nginx, PHP, Composer, Symfony, Twig, Doctrine, and SQLite3.

### Creating the product Entity and Controller

With the development environment up and running, it was time to dive into the core of the project. I began by defining the Product entity with properties and mapping information, and then created a ProductController with actions to handle requests related to products. Additionally, I configured routing to map requests to the ProductController and HomeController.

### Creating the Twig templates

I created a simple interface using Twig templates to define page structures and render dynamic content from the database. This allowed me to test the functionality of the site and make adjustments as necessary. I also utilized SQLite3 to simplify the database implementation and facilitate data management.

### Summary

</br>

This practice project is allowing me to learn and apply various skills and techniques using Symfony. I've set up the development environment, defined the Product entity and controller, configured routing, and created a basic user interface using Twig. I also utilized SQLite3 for simplified database implementation and achieved a functional CRUD system for the Product entity. Overall, this project is providing a valuable opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of the Symfony framework and its components, and I look forward to applying this knowledge to future projects.
